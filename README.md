# Step Counting Device

### Describe

- This project focuses on developing a smart wearable device capable of counting the user's steps. It utilizes the STM32F411RE - Nucleo Board and a 3-axis gyro sensor for precise motion detection. 
- Additionally, we have incorporated the MFRC522 IC, allowing user identification through pre-set ID_Cards. Once a user scans their card and the system successfully recognizes one of the pre-configured IDs, the device initiates step counting. Scanning the card again stops the counting process, all while displaying information on an OLED screen.

### Features

1. **User ID Recognition**: Scan the ID card to be able to activate the step measurement function corresponding to the user.

2. **Step Counting**: Measure the user's steps.

3. **Real-time Clock Display**: Displays the time from the beginning of the pedometer to the end.

4. **User Name Display**: Display the user name corresponding to the ID card.

### Hardware Components

### Detailed Features

1. **User ID Recognition**

| **Number** | **Functionality** | **Note** |
|:------|:-----|:-----|
| 1  | Identification of the ID code on the ID card | Users can scan the ID card to start taking the step counting device | 

2. **Step Counting**

| **Number** | **Functionality** | **Note** |
|:------|:-----|:-----|
| 1  | Step count | The device relies on a 3-angle sensor to be able to detect the user's movement and thereby provide accurate step data. |
